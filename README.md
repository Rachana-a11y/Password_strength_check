# Password_strength_Evaluation
🔐 Password Strength Evaluation
Cybersecurity Internship – Task 6

📌 Objective
To explore how password complexity affects security, test various passwords using the PasswordMonster tool, and understand common password attacks and prevention strategies.

🛠 Tool Used
PasswordMonster – https://passwordmonster.com
This tool shows how long a password would take to crack and gives feedback on its strength.

📝 What I Did
Created multiple sample passwords with different lengths and character combinations.

Tested each password using PasswordMonster.

Analyzed the crack time and feedback.

Researched common password attack methods.

Documented best practices for creating secure passwords.

🔐 What Makes a Password Strong
It should be at least 12 characters long.

It should include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.

Avoid using personal information like your name, date of birth, or common words.

Passphrases (like sentences) are better for memorability and strength.

Each account should have a unique password.

⚠️ Common Password Attack Methods
Brute Force Attack:
Tries every possible combination until the password is guessed. Short and simple passwords are easier to break this way.

Dictionary Attack:
Tries passwords using a list of common words and phrases. Avoid dictionary words like "password", "admin", or "qwerty".

Credential Stuffing:
Uses leaked username-password combinations from other sites. If you reuse the same password, this can compromise multiple accounts.

🛡 Best Practices for Password Security
Use long passwords (12+ characters).

Always use a combination of letter cases, numbers, and symbols.

Don’t reuse passwords across different platforms.

Use a password manager to store and create complex passwords safely.

Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for an extra layer of protection.
